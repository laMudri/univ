Operating systems -- supervision 2
=================================

1ai  | Cache memory stores a selection of data the OS expects to need soon.
     | This is much smaller than main memory, and quicker to access.
  ii | Main memory, ideally, should store all of the intermediate state of the
     | processes currently running. To avoid using other storage methods (such
     | as the hard disk), this should be large.
  iii| Registers store information being used immediately by the CPU. They
     | store a very small amount of information, and have very quick access
     | time.
 b   | When main memory has no available space, the OS will swap some memory to
     | disk. Thus, there will be virtual memory for which the physical address
     | is not in main memory.
2    | If an application blocks to read keyboard input, it will be suspended,
     | and resumed only when a keypress occurs. It will not be able to do any
     | processing or take any other input until a key has been pressed.
     | If the application does a non-blocking read, the operating system will
     | read the state of the keyboard and send this information back to the
     | application.
     | If the application does an asynchronous read, it will continue running.
     | When a keyboard event occurs, the operating system will send the
     | application a signal, and it will respond to that signal. In many
     | languages, this is how events are implemented.
