\section*{Notations and conventions}
The notation used here is under development. Details can be found at \url{http://fancyfahu.blogspot.co.uk}. \\

For the course, all numeric variables are assumed to be in \C.

\section{Definition of derivative, little o and big O}

\subsection{Differential equations introduction}
\begin{quotation}Newton's law of cooling: The rate of change of the temperature of a body is proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings.\end{quotation}

\prg{}This can be put into mathematical notation by assigning variables and functions to physical quantities. So:\\
\begin{tabular}{r l l}
quantity & symbol & type of symbol \\
\hline
time & $t$ & independent variable \\
temperature of the body & $T\,t$ & dependent variable \\
temperature of the surroundings & $T_0$ & constant \\
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Definition of differentiation}
\prg{}The derivative of the function $f$ at point $x$ is defined by the expression $$
\lim_0{\frac{\id}{f\,x-f\,(x+\id)}}
$$
\prg{}The intuition behind this can be seen in the diagram:
\prg{}(Diagram)
\prg{}This is written in various ways, many irrelevant in my notation but included for completeness:
$$
\frac{\mathrm dx}{\mathrm df}, \quad \frac{\mathrm dx}{\mathrm d}f, \quad D\,f\,x, \quad f'\,x
$$
\prg{}$f$ is differentiable at point $x$ iff the above limit exists. That is to say, the limit from the left is equal to the limit from the right. Since $f\,x$ is used in the limit definition, it must exist at the chosen point. A counterexample is the abs function at 0, where $\lim_{0^-}\frac{\id}{f\,x-f\,(x+\id)}=1^-$ and $\lim_{0^+}\frac{\id}{f\,x-f\,(x+\id)}=1$.
\prg{Ask}What if the lim variable is complex?

\subsection{Little $o$}
\prg{}Definition:
$$
f\in o_x\,g\iff\lim_x\frac g f=0
$$
\prg{}Intuitively, $f$ is much smaller than $g$ at point $x$. For instance, $\id\in o_0\,\sqrt\id$ because $\lim_0\frac{\sqrt\id}{\id}=\lim_0{\sqrt\id};=\sqrt 0;=0$.
